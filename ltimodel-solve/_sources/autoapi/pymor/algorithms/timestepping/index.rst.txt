.. py:module:: pymor.algorithms.timestepping

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Generic time-stepping algorithms for the solution of instationary problems.

   The algorithms are generic in the sense that each algorithms operates exclusively
   on |Operators| and |VectorArrays|. In particular, the algorithms
   can also be used to turn an arbitrary stationary |Model| provided
   by an external library into an instationary |Model|.

   Currently, implementations of :func:`explicit_euler` and :func:`implicit_euler`
   time-stepping are provided. The :class:`TimeStepper` defines a
   common interface that has to be fulfilled by the time-steppers used
   by |InstationaryModel|. The classes :class:`ExplicitEulerTimeStepper`
   and :class:`ImplicitEulerTimeStepper` encapsulate :func:`explicit_euler` and
   :func:`implicit_euler` to provide this interface.

.. class:: TimeStepper


   Bases: :py:obj:`pymor.core.base.ImmutableObject`

   Interface for time-stepping algorithms.

   Algorithms implementing this interface solve time-dependent problems
   of the form ::

       M * d_t u + A(u, mu, t) = F(mu, t).

   Time-steppers used by |InstationaryModel| have to fulfill
   this interface.

   .. method:: solve(self, initial_time, end_time, initial_data, operator, rhs=None, mass=None, mu=None, num_values=None)
      :abstractmethod:

      Apply time-stepper to the equation ::

          M * d_t u + A(u, mu, t) = F(mu, t).

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          initial_time
              The time at which to begin time-stepping.
          end_time
              The time until which to perform time-stepping.
          initial_data
              The solution vector at `initial_time`.
          operator
              The |Operator| A.
          rhs
              The right-hand side F (either |VectorArray| of length 1 or |Operator| with
              `source.dim == 1`). If `None`, zero right-hand side is assumed.
          mass
              The |Operator| M. If `None`, the identity operator is assumed.
          mu
              |Parameter values| for which `operator` and `rhs` are evaluated. The current
              time is added to `mu` with key `t`.
          num_values
              The number of returned vectors of the solution trajectory. If `None`, each
              intermediate vector that is calculated is returned.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          |VectorArray| containing the solution trajectory.
              



.. class:: ImplicitEulerTimeStepper(nt, solver_options='operator')

           recognized, in which case the solver_options of
           M (resp. A) are used.
