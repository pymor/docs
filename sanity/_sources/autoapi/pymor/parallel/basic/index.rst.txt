.. class:: WorkerPoolBase


   Bases: :py:obj:`WorkerPoolDefaultImplementations`, :py:obj:`pymor.parallel.interface.WorkerPool`

   Interface for parallel worker pools.

   |WorkerPools| allow to easily parallelize algorithms which involve
   no or little communication between the workers at runtime. The interface
   methods give the user simple means to distribute data to
   workers (:meth:`~WorkerPool.push`, :meth:`~WorkerPool.scatter_array`,
   :meth:`~WorkerPool.scatter_list`) and execute functions on
   the distributed data in parallel (:meth:`~WorkerPool.apply`),
   collecting the return values from each function call. A
   single worker can be instructed to execute a function using the
   :meth:`WorkerPool.apply_only` method. Finally, a parallelized
   :meth:`~WorkerPool.map` function is available, which
   automatically scatters the data among the workers.

   All operations are performed synchronously.

   .. method:: push(self, obj)

      Push a copy of `obj` to  all workers of the pool.

      A |RemoteObject| is returned as a handle to the pushed object.
      This object can be used as a keyword argument to :meth:`~WorkerPool.apply`,
      :meth:`~WorkerPool.apply_only`, :meth:`~WorkerPool.map`
      and will then be transparently mapped to the respective copy
      of the pushed object on the worker.

      |Immutable| objects will be pushed only once. If the same |immutable| object
      is pushed a second time, the returned |RemoteObject| will refer to the
      already transferred copy. It is therefore safe to use `push` to ensure
      that a given |immutable| object is available on the worker. No unnecessary
      copies will be created.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          obj
              The object to push to all workers.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          A |RemoteObject| referring to the pushed data.
              


   .. method:: _map_kwargs(self, kwargs)


   .. method:: apply(self, function, *args, **kwargs)

      Apply function in parallel on each worker.

      This calls `function` on each worker in parallel, passing `args` as
      positional and `kwargs` as keyword arguments. Keyword arguments
      which are |RemoteObjects| are automatically mapped to the
      respective object on the worker. Moreover, keyword arguments which
      are |immutable| objects that have already been pushed to the workers
      will not be transmitted again. (|Immutable| objects which have not
      been pushed before will be transmitted and the remote copy will be
      destroyed after function execution.)

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          function
              The function to execute on each worker.
          args
              The positional arguments for `function`.
          kwargs
              The keyword arguments for `function`.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          List of return values of the function executions, ordered by
          worker number (from `0` to `len(pool) - 1`).
              


   .. method:: apply_only(self, function, worker, *args, **kwargs)

      Apply function on a single worker.

      This calls `function` on on the worker with number `worker`, passing
      `args` as positional and `kwargs` as keyword arguments. Keyword arguments
      which are |RemoteObjects| are automatically mapped to the
      respective object on the worker. Moreover, keyword arguments which
      are |immutable| objects that have already been pushed to the workers
      will not be transmitted again. (|Immutable| objects which have not
      been pushed before will be transmitted and the remote copy will be
      destroyed after function execution.)

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          function
              The function to execute.
          worker
              The worker on which to execute the function. (Number between
              `0` and `len(pool) - 1`.)
          args
              The positional arguments for `function`.
          kwargs
              The keyword arguments for `function`.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          Return value of the function execution.
              


   .. method:: map(self, function, *args, **kwargs)

      Parallel version of the builtin :func:`map` function.

      Each positional argument (after `function`) must be a sequence
      of same length n. `map` calls `function` in parallel on each of these n
      positional argument combinations, always passing `kwargs` as keyword
      arguments.  Keyword arguments which are |RemoteObjects| are automatically
      mapped to the respective object on the worker. Moreover, keyword arguments
      which are |immutable| objects that have already been pushed to the workers
      will not be transmitted again. (|Immutable| objects which have not
      been pushed before will be transmitted and the remote copy will be
      destroyed after function execution.)

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          function
              The function to execute on each worker.
          args
              The sequences of positional arguments for `function`.
          kwargs
              The keyword arguments for `function`.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          List of return values of the function executions, ordered by
          the sequence of positional arguments.
              


   .. method:: _split_into_chunks(self, count, *args)



.. class:: GenericRemoteObject(pool, remote_id, uid=None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`pymor.parallel.interface.RemoteObject`

   Handle to remote data on the workers of a |WorkerPool|.

   See documentation of :class:`WorkerPool` for usage
   of these handles in conjunction with :meth:`~WorkerPool.apply`,
   :meth:`~WorkerPool.scatter_array`,
   :meth:`~WorkerPool.scatter_list`.

   Remote objects can be used as a context manager: when leaving the
   context, the remote object's :meth:`~RemoteObject.remove`
   method is called to ensure proper cleanup of remote resources.

   .. attribute:: removed

      `True`, after :meth:`remove` has been called.
      

   .. method:: _remove(self)

      Actual implementation of 'remove'.



.. function:: _append_array_slice(s, U=None)


.. function:: _append_list_slice(s, l=None)
