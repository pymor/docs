.. class:: NumpyVectorArray(array, space)


   Bases: :py:obj:`pymor.vectorarrays.interface.VectorArray`

   |VectorArray| implementation via |NumPy arrays|.

   This is the default |VectorArray| type used by all |Operators|
   in pyMOR's discretization toolkit. Moreover, all reduced |Operators|
   are based on |NumpyVectorArray|.

   This class is just a thin wrapper around the underlying
   |NumPy array|. Thus, while operations like
   :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interface.VectorArray.axpy` or
   :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interface.VectorArray.inner`
   will be quite efficient, removing or appending vectors will
   be costly.

   .. warning::
       This class is not intended to be instantiated directly. Use
       the associated :class:`VectorSpace <NumpyVectorSpace>` instead.

   .. attribute:: __radd__
      

      

   .. method:: to_numpy(self, ensure_copy=False)

      Return (len(self), self.dim) NumPy Array with the data stored in the array.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          ensure_copy
              If `False`, modifying the returned |NumPy array| might alter the original
              |VectorArray|. If `True` always a copy of the array data is made.
              


   .. method:: _data(self)
      :property:

      Return NumPy Array view on data for hacking / interactive use.


   .. method:: real(self)
      :property:

      Real part.


   .. method:: imag(self)
      :property:

      Imaginary part.


   .. method:: conj(self)

      Complex conjugation.


   .. method:: __len__(self)

      The number of vectors in the array.


   .. method:: __getitem__(self, ind)

      Return a |VectorArray| view onto a subset of the vectors in the array.


   .. method:: __delitem__(self, ind)

      Remove vectors from the array.


   .. method:: copy(self, deep=False, *, _ind=None)

      Returns a copy of the array.

      All |VectorArray| implementations in pyMOR have copy-on-write semantics:
      if not specified otherwise by setting `deep` to `True`, the returned
      copy will hold a handle to the same array data as the original array,
      and a deep copy of the data will only be performed when one of the arrays
      is modified.

      Note that for |NumpyVectorArray|, a deep copy is always performed when only
      some vectors in the array are copied.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          deep
              Ensure that an actual copy of the array data is made (see above).
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          A copy of the |VectorArray|.
              


   .. method:: append(self, other, remove_from_other=False)

      Append vectors to the array.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          other
              A |VectorArray| containing the vectors to be appended.
          remove_from_other
              If `True`, the appended vectors are removed from `other`.
              For list-like implementations this can be used to prevent
              unnecessary copies of the involved vectors.
              


   .. method:: scal(self, alpha, *, _ind=None)

      BLAS SCAL operation (in-place scalar multiplication).

      This method calculates ::

          self = alpha*self

      If `alpha` is a scalar, each vector is multiplied by this scalar. Otherwise, `alpha`
      has to be a one-dimensional |NumPy array| of the same length as `self`
      containing the factors for each vector.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          alpha
              The scalar coefficient or one-dimensional |NumPy array| of coefficients
              with which the vectors in `self` are multiplied.
              


   .. method:: axpy(self, alpha, x, *, _ind=None)

      BLAS AXPY operation.

      This method forms the sum ::

          self = alpha*x + self

      If the length of `x` is 1, the same `x` vector is used for all vectors
      in `self`. Otherwise, the lengths of `self`  and `x` have to agree.
      If `alpha` is a scalar, each `x` vector is multiplied with the same factor `alpha`.
      Otherwise, `alpha` has to be a one-dimensional |NumPy array| of the same length as
      `self` containing the coefficients for each `x` vector.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          alpha
              The scalar coefficient or one-dimensional |NumPy array| of coefficients with which
              the vectors in `x` are multiplied.
          x
              A |VectorArray| containing the x-summands.
              


   .. method:: inner(self, other, product=None, *, _ind=None)

      Returns the inner products between |VectorArray| elements.

      If `product` is `None`, the Euclidean inner product between
      the :meth:`dofs` of `self` and `other` are returned, i.e. ::

          U.inner(V)

      is equivalent to::

          U.dofs(np.arange(U.dim)) @ V.dofs(np.arange(V.dim)).T

      (Note, that :meth:`dofs` is only intended to be called for a
      small number of DOF indices.)

      If a `product` |Operator| is specified, this |Operator| is
      used to compute the inner products using
      :meth:`~pymor.operators.inerface.Operator.apply2`, i.e.
      `U.inner(V, product)` is equivalent to::

          product.apply2(U, V)

      which in turn is, by default, implemented as::

          U.inner(product.apply(V))

      In the case of complex numbers, this is antilinear in the
      first argument, i.e. in 'self'.
      Complex conjugation is done in the first argument because
      most numerical software in the community handles it this way:
      Numpy, DUNE, FEniCS, Eigen, Matlab and BLAS do complex conjugation
      in the first argument, only PetSc and deal.ii do complex
      conjugation in the second argument.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

          other
              A |VectorArray| containing the second factors.
          product
              If not `None` an |Operator| representing the inner product
              bilinear form.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          A |NumPy array| `result` such that
              
              result[i, j] = ( self[i], other[j] ).
              


   .. method:: pairwise_inner(self, other, product=None, *, _ind=None)

      Returns the pairwise inner products between |VectorArray| elements.

      If `product` is `None`, the Euclidean inner product between
      the :meth:`dofs` of `self` and `other` are returned, i.e. ::

          U.pairwise_inner(V)

      is equivalent to::

          np.sum(U.dofs(np.arange(U.dim)) * V.dofs(np.arange(V.dim)), axis=-1)

      (Note, that :meth:`dofs` is only intended to be called for a
      small number of DOF indices.)

      If a `product` |Operator| is specified, this |Operator| is
      used to compute the inner products using
      :meth:`~pymor.operators.inerface.Operator.pairwise_apply2`, i.e.
      `U.inner(V, product)` is equivalent to::

          product.pairwise_apply2(U, V)

      which in turn is, by default, implemented as::

          U.pairwise_inner(product.apply(V))

      In the case of complex numbers, this is antilinear in the
      first argument, i.e. in 'self'.
      Complex conjugation is done in the first argument because
      most numerical software in the community handles it this way:
      Numpy, DUNE, FEniCS, Eigen, Matlab and BLAS do complex conjugation
      in the first argument, only PetSc and deal.ii do complex
      conjugation in the second argument.

              bilinear form.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          A |NumPy array| `result` such that
              
              result[i] = ( self[i], other[i] ).
              
              


   .. method:: lincomb(self, coefficients, *, _ind=None)

      Returns linear combinations of the vectors contained in the array.

      .. admonition:: Parameters

              A |NumPy array| of dimension 1 or 2 containing the linear
              coefficients. `coefficients.shape[-1]` has to agree with
              `len(self)`.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          A |VectorArray| `result` such that
              
              result[i] = ∑ self[j] * coefficients[i,j]
              
          in case `coefficients` is of dimension 2, otherwise
          `len(result) == 1` and
              
              result[0] = ∑ self[j] * coefficients[j].

      BLAS AXPY operation.

      This method forms the sum ::

   .. method:: inner(self, other, product=None)

      Returns the inner products between |VectorArray| elements.

      If `product` is `None`, the Euclidean inner product between
      the :meth:`dofs` of `self` and `other` are returned, i.e. ::

          U.inner(V)

      is equivalent to::

          U.dofs(np.arange(U.dim)) @ V.dofs(np.arange(V.dim)).T

      (Note, that :meth:`dofs` is only intended to be called for a
      small number of DOF indices.)

      If a `product` |Operator| is specified, this |Operator| is
      used to compute the inner products using
      :meth:`~pymor.operators.inerface.Operator.apply2`, i.e.
      `U.inner(V, product)` is equivalent to::

          product.apply2(U, V)

      which in turn is, by default, implemented as::

          U.inner(product.apply(V))

              A |VectorArray| containing the second factors.
          product
              If not `None` an |Operator| representing the inner product
              bilinear form.
              
      .. admonition:: Returns

          A |NumPy array| `result` such that
              
              result[i, j] = ( self[i], other[j] ).
              


   .. method:: pairwise_inner(self, other, product=None)

      Returns the pairwise inner products between |VectorArray| elements.

      If `product` is `None`, the Euclidean inner product between
      the :meth:`dofs` of `self` and `other` are returned, i.e. ::

          U.pairwise_inner(V)

      is equivalent to::

          np.sum(U.dofs(np.arange(U.dim)) * V.dofs(np.arange(V.dim)), axis=-1)

      (Note, that :meth:`dofs` is only intended to be called for a
      small number of DOF indices.)

      If a `product` |Operator| is specified, this |Operator| is
      used to compute the inner products using
      :meth:`~pymor.operators.inerface.Operator.pairwise_apply2`, i.e.
      `U.inner(V, product)` is equivalent to::

          product.pairwise_apply2(U, V)

      which in turn is, by default, implemented as::

          U.pairwise_inner(product.apply(V))

      In the case of complex numbers, this is antilinear in the
      first argument, i.e. in 'self'.
      Complex conjugation is done in the first argument because
      most numerical software in the community handles it this way:
      Numpy, DUNE, FEniCS, Eigen, Matlab and BLAS do complex conjugation
      in the first argument, only PetSc and deal.ii do complex
      conjugation in the second argument.

          in case `coefficients` is of dimension 2, otherwise
          `len(result) == 1` and
