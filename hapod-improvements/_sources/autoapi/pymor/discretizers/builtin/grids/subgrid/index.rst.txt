.. class:: SubGrid(parent_grid, parent_entities)


   Bases: :py:obj:`pymor.discretizers.builtin.grids.interfaces.Grid`

   A subgrid of a |Grid|.

   Given a |Grid| and a list of codim-0 entities we construct the minimal
   subgrid of the grid, containing all the given entities.

   .. admonition:: Parameters

       parent_grid
           |Grid| of which a subgrid is to be created.
       parent_entities
           |NumPy array| of global indices of the codim-0 entities which
           are to be contained in the subgrid.
           
   .. attribute:: parent_grid

      The |Grid| from which the subgrid was constructed. :class:`Subgrid`
      only stores a :mod:`weakref` to the grid, so accessing this property
      might return `None` if the original grid has been destroyed.
      

   .. attribute:: reference_element
      

      

   .. method:: parent_indices(self, codim)

      `retval[e]` is the index of the `e`-th codim-`codim` entity in the parent grid.


   .. method:: indices_from_parent_indices(self, ind, codim)

      Maps a |NumPy array| of indicies of codim-`codim` entites of the parent grid to indicies
      of the subgrid.

      .. admonition:: Raises

          ValueError
              Not all provided indices correspond to entities contained in the subgrid.
              


   .. method:: size(self, codim)

      The number of entities of codimension `codim`.


   .. method:: subentities(self, codim, subentity_codim)

      `retval[e,s]` is the global index of the `s`-th codim-`subentity_codim` subentity of the
      codim-`codim` entity with global index `e`.

      The ordering of `subentities(0, subentity_codim)[e]` has to correspond, w.r.t. the embedding
      of `e`, to the local ordering inside the reference element.

      For `codim > 0`, we provide a default implementation by calculating the subentities of `e`
      as follows:

          1. Find the `codim-1` parent entity `e_0` of `e` with minimal global index
          2. Lookup the local indices of the subentities of `e` inside `e_0` using the reference
             element.
          3. Map these local indices to global indices using
             `subentities(codim - 1, subentity_codim)`.

      This procedures assures that `subentities(codim, subentity_codim)[e]` has the right ordering
      w.r.t. the embedding determined by `e_0`, which agrees with what is returned by
      `embeddings(codim)`


   .. method:: embeddings(self, codim)

      Returns tuple `(A, B)` where `A[e]` and `B[e]` are the linear part and the translation
      part of the map from the reference element of `e` to `e`.

      For `codim > 0`, we provide a default implementation by taking the embedding of the codim-1
      parent entity `e_0` of `e` with lowest global index and composing it with the
      subentity_embedding of `e` into `e_0` determined by the reference element.


   .. method:: __getstate__(self)



.. function:: make_sub_grid_boundary_info(sub_grid, parent_grid, parent_grid_boundary_info, new_boundary_type=None)

   Derives a |BoundaryInfo| for a :class:`~pymor.discretizers.builtin.grids.subgrid.SubGrid`.

   .. admonition:: Parameters

       sub_grid
           The :class:`~pymor.discretizers.builtin.grids.subgrid.SubGrid` for which a
           |BoundaryInfo| is created.
       parent_grid
           The parent |Grid|.
       parent_grid_boundary_info
           The |BoundaryInfo| of the parent |Grid| from which to derive the |BoundaryInfo|
       new_boundary_type
           The boundary type which is assigned to the new boundaries of `subgrid`. If
           `None`, no boundary type is assigned.
           
   .. admonition:: Returns

       |BoundaryInfo| associated with sub_grid.
